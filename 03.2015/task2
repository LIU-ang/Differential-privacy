It's pretty important to preserve our reading notes and reading progress. Because this would be a long term project. In order to make sure we can always warm up what we did before, we must notes clearly once we finish each part of the paper.

Congratulations you have learnt how to use git.

Now this is today's task for you
1. Try to edit git files directly in brower
2. Write notes in cpp file to recording your past reading understanding
3. Write the questions and confusions in README file. Also write what you may not sure or what you would like to discuss with me under the corresponding paper's section.
(README file follows super easy syntax and you would grasp it within 3 minutes. Try to figure it out.)
4. Write your daily timeline at the bottom of the README
